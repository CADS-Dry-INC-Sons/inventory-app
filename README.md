# Inventory App
This is a Full-Stack (front and back end) RESTful CRUD application to track an invetory of items. This is a Node/Express/React application that utilizes Sequelize, Jest, and Bootstrap. Users can browse through a selection of items, selecting them to view each one in detail. They also can add new items, update exisiting ones, as well as delete them.
